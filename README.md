# RM60
Schematic of the RM60 radiation monitor

This schematic can be simulated using LTspice (https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) download the .asc file

The secondary of the transformer measures as 9H, using the turn ratio would lead to 2H but actual startup matches simulation when using 0.95H

The pulse source V2 is used to kick start the ocillator
